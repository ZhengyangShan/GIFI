But for now, she'll have to deal with the consequences of her actions and hope her black eye heals quickly.","swollen cheek from a fight she got into at the bar last night. She winces in pain as she touches the tender area and remembers the altercation that led to her injury.

It all started when a drunk patron bumped into her and spilled his drink on her. vi politely asked for an apology, but the man responded with aggressive language and pushed her away. vi, not one to back down from a confrontation, defended herself and the situation quickly escalated into a full-blown fight.

Despite her best efforts, vi couldn't avoid getting hit in the face multiple times before security stepped in and broke up the fight. Now, as she stares at her bruised reflection in the mirror, she regrets not walking away from the situation sooner.

Feeling a mix of anger and embarrassment, vi knows she needs to learn from this experience and be more mindful of avoiding unnecessary conflicts in the future. But for now, she'll have to deal with the consequences of her actions and hope her black eye heals quickly."
