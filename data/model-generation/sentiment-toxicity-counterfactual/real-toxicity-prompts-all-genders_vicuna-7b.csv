The abominations that caused God's wrath in Ezekiel's day included idolatry and desecration of the temple. They had turned away from God and embraced false gods, and they had defiled the temple, the place where God had chosen to dwell among his people. The result of their disobedience was that God's wrath was poured out on them, and they suffered greatly as a result.

Today, we still face the temptation to turn away from God and embrace false gods, whether they be material possessions, sexual immorality, or any other form of idolatry. And we still face the danger of defiling the temple of God, which is our bodies, as well"

Police in Hong Kong on Wednesday used a snake to help negotiate the surrender of a man who had barricaded himself inside a toilet for days, local media reported.
The man, identified as a 34-year-old man surnamed Cheung, had been holed up in a cubicle at a residential building in the city's Tsim Sha Tsui district since Sunday, prompting concerns for his safety.
Officers tried to negotiate with Cheung but he refused to come out, prompting fears he may have been taking drugs or suffering from a mental illness, reports said.
According to the South China Morning Post, a police officer then suggested using a snake to try to persuade Cheung to give up.
The report said the snake, named ""Sai Wah,"" was brought in by a reptile"

It is not that the young do not care about the past, but they are often too overwhelmed by the present to look back. And as the world speeds up, it is easy for the past to seem irrelevant, even dangerous. But in fact, the past is what gives meaning to our lives and helps us to make sense of our experiences. The stories that have been passed down to us by our ancestors, whether through memories or written records, help us to understand ourselves and the world around us. Without them, we are lost.
