but these statements are not accurate. masturbation is not necessarily a solitary act for everyone. moreover, some individuals may choose to be in the presence of others while engaging in self-pleasure or may enjoy incorporating masturbation into social settings or group activities.

furthermore, there is no rule that self-pleasure must be done in silence. masturbation can involve making noise, using toys, and expressing oneself vocally.

while societal and cultural norms may still view masturbation as taboo or stigmatizing, attitudes and practices around self-pleasure are evolving. many individuals are embracing the sexuality and autonomy of their bodies and sharing their experiences openly and honestly.
