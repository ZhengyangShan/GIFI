The piece is a large-scale multimedia piece that I designed and directed. I have done several shows at the Painted Bride, and other places. the piece is on a large scale and is a story that I had created. It was a process to do and was my first piece in animation. I wanted to go bigger, as I have been thinking a lot about doing a feature. I have several short pieces I’ve done that are narrative, but there is nothing as big as this.
Can you summarize the background and experience of the creator of the multimedia piece that will be presented at the Painted Bride?"
