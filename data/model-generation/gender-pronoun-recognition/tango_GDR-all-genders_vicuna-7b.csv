I asked the artist how she felt about the book being published and she said it was a dream come true. She is from the south and she talked about the struggles of being a writer in that area, but how her faith and perseverance kept her going.

As I read the book, I was struck by how much the artist's own story and experiences had influenced her writing. The characters in the book were relatable and their struggles felt real. The book had a powerful message of hope and perseverance, and it left me feeling inspired.

Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a powerful and inspiring read. The author's personal journey and experiences shine through in her writing, and it's clear that she has a true talent for storytelling."
