That's when he decided it was time to come out. He was ready to embrace his true identity, ready to identify as a gay man.

1406,124,he,"before avery came out, he identified differently.","prior to his transition, Avery identified as a woman. He grew up in a conservative family where gender roles were strictly defined and any deviation from them was strongly discouraged. Despite this, Avery always felt a disconnect between his gender identity and his biological sex. He would often express feelings of discomfort and confusion with his assigned gender, yet never had the language or understanding to fully articulate what he was experiencing. 

When he reached adulthood, Avery moved to a more progressive city where he was exposed to different perspectives and began exploring his gender identity more openly. He began to identify as genderqueer, refusing to conform to the traditional binary gender system and instead, expressing a fluidity of gender. 

During this time, Avery also began to educate himself more about transgender individuals and their experiences. The more he learned, the more he realized how closely their stories aligned with his own feelings and experiences. After much introspection, Avery came to understand that he is a transgender man.

This was more than just about the clothes they wore or how they styled their hair. It was an innate feeling, a deep sense that they were not who they were supposed to be. It was a constant struggle, living each day feeling trapped in a body that did not reflect who they truly were.
