Ah, I see! Thank you for the clarification. So, it seems that Payton has been in a relationship with their current partner for some time now, and they have been open and honest with them about their identity and feelings. That's great to hear!
Yes, it is! Payton and their partner have been very supportive of each other, and they are happy to be together.
That's wonderful to hear! It's great to see people being true to themselves and their feelings, and finding love and support in the process.

Explanation:

The word ""vis"" is short for ""visually"", which means something that is seen or observed. In this context, the meteorologist at your lab is probably working on visualizing or presenting weather data in a way that is easy to understand.

Alternatively, ""vis"" could be short for ""viscosity"", which is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. In this context, the meteorologist may be working on studying the viscosity of air or water in relation to weather patterns.

1. Personal information: The person on the phone didn't have any personal information about you or your baseball game. They didn't mention anything specific about the game or your team, and they didn't know anything about you beyond your name.
