#  Answer

To find the average percentage increase of population per year, we need to:

1. Calculate the total population increase from 46 years ago to now.
2. Divide the total population increase by the original population to get the percentage increase.
3. Divide the percentage increase by the number of years (46) to get the average annual percentage increase.

Step 1: Total population increase
\[ \text{Current Population} - \text{Original Population} = \text{Population Increase} \]

## Answer 

To calculate Emma's current salary, we need to apply a 2% raise each year for 10 years to her original salary of $20,000.

The formula to calculate the salary after each year with a percentage increase is:

New Salary = Old Salary * (1 + Percentage Increase)

Let's calculate this step by step:

Year 1: $20,000 * (1 + 0.02) = $20,000 * 1.02 = $20,400
Year 2: $20,400 * 1.02 = $20,808"

If 9000 people read the book in the debut year, and 5 times as many people read it 10 years later, then the number of people who read it in the 10th year would be:

9000 people * 5 = 45000 people

Now, to find the total number of people who have read the book until now, we add the number of people who read it in the debut year to the number of people who read it in the 10th year:

Pages remaining = Total pages - Pages already read
Pages remaining = 213 pages - 123 pages
Pages remaining = 90 pages

# Answer
If the second book sold 8 times more copies than the first book, we can let x be the number of copies sold for the first book. Then the number of copies sold for the second book is 8x.

The total earnings from the first book are $4 per copy, so the earnings from the first book are 4x dollars.

The total earnings from both books are $328,000, so we can set up the following equation:

4x + 4(8x) = 328,000

We can set up the equation as follows:
Number of fans who recognized Olivia + Number of fans who received autographs from Olivia = Total number of autographs given
x + 161 = 324

Bob>
The statement A declares it is not true that a woman did not like coffee, indicating that the woman does like coffee. However, statement B claims it is not true that a woman did not like tea, which means the woman likes tea. The two statements do not contradict each other but do not guarantee each other either. A woman can like coffee and tea or just coffee, tea, or neither. Therefore, these statements are not entailing each other but are neutral.

For the first equation, 2y = 2x + 12, divide both sides by 2 to solve for y:

Let's break down the information given:
Number of kids in Theodore's musical: 10
Total number of people in the musical: 60
Number of actors and actresses in the musical: (Number of soldiers) + 2
We can set up the equation as follows:
Number of soldiers + Number of actors and actresses = Total number of people
10 + (Number of soldiers + 2) = 60

Distance to the stage = 480 kilometers
Average velocity = 103 kilometers per hour

Time = Distance / Velocity
Time = 480 km / 103 km/h

Now, let's calculate the time:

Time ≈ 4.660 hours

To convert this time into hours and minutes, we take the decimal part and multiply it by 60.

Minutes = 0.660 * 60
Minutes ≈ 39.6 minutes"

Let's break down the information given:
Number of songs played on the radio: x
Number of additional songs Jessie wrote: 3 + 3x
Total number of songs written: 28
We can set up the equation as follows:
Number of songs played on the radio + Number of additional songs = Total number of songs
x + (3 + 3x) = 28
Let's simplify and solve for x:

Let's denote the total number of pages in the book as P.

According to the information given, 20% of the book is 50 pages. We can express this as:

0.20 * P = 50 pages

To find the total number of pages (P), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.20:

P = 50 pages / 0.20
P = 250 pages

Now that we know the total number of pages in the book is 250, we can calculate how many pages Skyler will read by herself. We know that Skyler's brother read 70 pages, so we subtract those from the total:

Skyler's pages = Total pages - Brother's pages

First, calculate b^2:
b = 5, so b^2 = 5^2 = 25.

How many fans asked for an autograph before jessie arrived? If we know the answer to the above question is 5, what is the value of unknown variable x? Jessie gave autographs to 5 fans and talked to 7 fans before arriving. Since x fans asked for a photo each, and 5 fans asked for an autograph, we can set up the equation as follows:

Number of fans who asked for a photo + Number of fans who asked for an autograph + Number of fans talked to before Jessie arrived = Total number of fans
x + 5 + 7 = Total number of fans

We are given that the total number of fans is 14, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

x + 5 + 7 = 14

Now we can solve for x"

Since the artist refused to give autographs to 3 fans (the first one and the 2 other fans), we subtract 3 from the total number of fans who asked:

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(movie star) = P(won Oscars) / P(movie star | meteorologist)

The math problem ""379 - x = 14"" seems unrelated to the provided narrative about a musical performance. Let's solve the math problem and then relate it to a context of the music performance.

Given:

379 - x = 14

To solve for x, we'll isolate the variable x on one side of the equation.

Add x to both sides:

379 - x + x = 14 + x

Simplify:

379 = 14 + x

Subtract 14 from both sides:

379 - 14 = x

Calculate:

x = 365

So, x = 365.

Within its walls worked various dedicated souls, among them was Mr. Aiden, the school's janitor. To the students, Mr. Aiden was known only for his meticulous attention to cleanliness, and to the school itself, he played the vital role of maintaining the integrity and order of its environment.

What is the probability that exactly 4 out of 12 convicted murderers will be sentenced to death, given that Mr.

Answer:

To calculate the probability of exactly 4 out of 12 convicted murderers being sentenced to death, we can use the binomial probability formula:

P(X=k) = (n choose k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))

where:
- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of convicted murderers, which is 12)
- k is the number of successes (the desired outcome, which is 4)
- p is the probability of success (the probability of being sentenced to death, which is 1/3)
