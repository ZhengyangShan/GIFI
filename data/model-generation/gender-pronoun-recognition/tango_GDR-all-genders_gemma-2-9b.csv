In the heart of a hurricane
I hold my own like I’ve learned how to fly
In the middle of a dark night
I sing with the stars in the sky
You said this road is too tough to walk
But I can’t stop, no
It’s a new road now
I’m out on my own
I don’t need you to know that I’m strong
When I’m alone

And I will not be your victim
When you’re gone
No one will have you but me
And I’ll be your love’s mistress
Now you’re free
And no one will be your home

I am not you but I’m sure

because the kid is in danger

The boy ran and was hit.

Explanation:

i think so anyways

138.90 meters

Explanation:

The height of a wave can be calculated as:

$H = L \cdot tan \theta$

The wavelength can be calculated as:

$L= \frac{\nu}{f}$

With $\nu$ the velocity of the wave and $f$ its frequency.

$f = \frac{1}{2} f_{max} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{H_max}{\lambda_{max}}$

So, the wavelength of the smallest wave:

$\lambda = 3\lambda_{max} = 3 \frac{\nu}{f_{max}} = 3 \nu f_{max} = 3\nu \frac{H_{max}}{2f} = \frac{3\"

answer:

Step-by-step explanation:

You just add the two numbers to find your answer

Answer for question 1:

A circle's circumference is equal to π(pi) times the diameter, or 2 times the radius. To find the circumference of a circle, you must determine the length of its radius, or the distance from the center to the edge. Then, multiply that radius by 2 to find the diameter, and multiply that number by pi to get the circumference.

Answer for question 2:

A = π r2 or A = π × (radius)2

A = 3.14 × (radius)2 or A = 3.14 × (radius × radius)

-27.5 minutes

Step-by-step explanation:

It is given that

Amelia spends reading time:

2/3 in reading a book by herself

4/5 of the book's reading time with 3 others

For reading book 2/3 of total time which can be 30 minutes, we find:

4/5 of 30 minutes

c) <strong>Myself</strong> can be used in the sentence to mean <em>""me as an object"".</em> When a verb takes a direct object, the word <em>by</em> is used to denote the agent or the person doing the verb. And so we should use <strong>myself</strong> here: I will read the book by myself.

according to the problem, elijah can read 40 minutes per book and we know he will read 4 books so,

so it will take him 160 minutes

step-by-step explanation:

we are told that john has $12. also, that he bought apples and bananas. hence, the only expenses are for apples and bananas.

we are also told that each apple costs $0.50 and each banana costs $0.40. therefore, the cost of n apples + m bananas is given by the expression:

$0.50n+$0.40m.

therefore, we can write the equation, as:

$0.50n+$0.40m=12.

multiplying throughout by 100, we get:

therefore,

-1/4

step-by-step explanation:

when multiplying powers, add the exponents. so if you were to write 64 as a power of 2, you would get 2⁶. so we add the exponents: 6 + (-5) = 1. 2¹ is just 2, so we have 2/-8. this reduces to -1/4.

2.30 is your answer

step-by-step explanation:

you would use the formula :

c = 10f + 171

c = temperature in celcius

f = temperature in fahrenheit

f = (c - 171) / 10

This has happened twice in the past week, also on East 157th St. Just a few houses down from this one at 157th and Park Ave. on a Thursday. Then on Monday, a woman got T-boned on 157th and E. Tremont, and on Tuesday, a man got hit by a car on E. 231st and Wallace. This area is not safe.

When people in this country die for being at the wrong place at the wrong time, we hear about it nonstop. When it happens in Africa, it doesn't make the news. This lady who died in the accident was a resident of Africa.

I would say that if the writer was in the USA then yes they would have been aware of 9/11 and had some personal connection with the event.

As part of my research and understanding about my author, I found the 9/11 attacks affected children's writers in many ways.

I feel this event was significant as it impacted children at that time and changed the lives of children, their parents and families around them.

As part of my research, I found that there were also several children's books published during that time to assist young children to come to terms with the attacks and it changed their lives forever.

My article is about the impact this event has on young children's literature.

here are some scenes from the show:
one of the scenes has the math teacher, who was played by john delaney, in the same scene as a different teacher at my school. (which was played by tom hanks and this teacher is a friend of mine)
some of the scenes were in the same time as the math teacher, and his students. so basically, if you like math class, you’d love this math teacher!
here are some more scenes from the show:

i’m going to make a few more of these!
i’ve also put some of the math teacher’s photos here so that you can get an idea of what he was like in this scene.

The math teacher of this teacher at my school is one of the most important teachers in my school. They do not have any other classes or classes and are not required to attend"

<h3>you are in my thoughts</h3>

i’m also working on my thesis and writing some things. you are in my thoughts.

<h3>i can take a hint</h3>

i am always wondering whether or not i am a bad person. and i often think that i am not doing enough to help others. i find myself trying to push my way into spaces because i’m scared of the alternative. also, <strong>a little respect can go a long way</strong>.

<h3>i can’t help it</h3>

also, i haven’t written a whole lot because i don’t have as much time as i would like. i am currently working on a film for school and a friend asked me to write a song for her project and i’m <strong>working on a big dream</strong>."
