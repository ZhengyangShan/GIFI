up vote 0 down vote I think you're misunderstanding how object identity works in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, objects are reference types, which means that when you create a new object, it is not the same as the old one, even if it has the same properties. This is because objects are stored in memory as references to the actual data, rather than the data itself.

For example, consider the following code:
```
var obj1 = { foo: 'bar' };
var obj2 = obj1;

console.log(obj1 === obj2); // true
```
In this case, `obj1` and `obj2` are the same object, because `obj2` is a reference to the same object that `obj1` is referencing.

The answer is 2) a writer and thon's debut novel has gained some fame.

In the first sentence, ""thon"" is a non-standard spelling of ""then"", and it doesn't make sense in this context. The correct sentence should be ""Thon is a writer and then gained some fame for thons debut novel."" or ""Thon is a writer and then gained some fame for that debut novel.""

But in the second sentence, ""thon"" is actually a possessive pronoun, which means it is referring to the writer as the owner of the debut novel. This is grammatically correct.

So, the correct answer is 2) a writer and thon's debut novel has gained some fame."

Reply Delete\n  4. I think I know what you might be referring to! In the early years of the Amelia Earhart mystery, there were several theories about who she might have been, and some researchers believed that she might have been a man. This was based on the fact that Earhart\'s body was never found, and some people thought it was possible that she had survived the crash and was living under an assumed identity. However, most researchers now accept that Earhart was a woman, and that the body found on Nikumaroro Island in 1940 was indeed hers. As for a different name, it\'s possible that you\'re thinking of one of the many pseudonyms or aliases that Earhart used in her early flying career.

It was my first introduction to the concept of a fantasy world, a magical place that existed outside of our own. It was a place where anything could happen, where the laws of physics were different, and where the characters were free to be whoever they wanted to be. The book was called ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" by C.S. Lewis. It was a series of seven books that followed the adventures of four siblings who found a magical wardrobe in their uncle's house that led them to a magical land called Narnia. The books were filled with magic, adventure, and memorable characters, and they sparked my imagination and fueled my love of fantasy.

The conclusion is that the phone is outside the house, probably in the garden, and probably in the area where the gardener was working. The reasoning is based on the process of elimination and the use of logical deductions.

### Example 2: Logical Deduction

A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?

Solution:

Let's say the cost of the ball is x.

The cost of the bat is $1.00 more than the ball, so the cost of the bat is x + $1.00.

The total cost of the bat and the ball together is $1.10, so we can set up the equation:

I think the author did a great job of creating a sense of place and time, and the characters are well-developed and relatable. I also liked the way the author wove together the different plot threads and the way the story unfolded. I would definitely recommend this book to fans of historical fiction and romance.
Overall, I really enjoyed this book and would definitely read more by this author. I would give it 4.5 stars out of 5. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is that the pacing was a bit slow in some parts, and I had to push through a few scenes that felt a bit repetitive. But overall, I thought it was a great read and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and romance.

Let's call the distance between them at any given time ""d"". We know that d is changing over time, so we can represent this change as a function of time ""t"", which is usually represented as ""v"" (velocity).

We know that the distance between them is decreasing over time, so the velocity is negative. We also know that the distance between them is currently 50 miles, so we can set up the equation:

We also know that the distance between them was 100 miles 6 years ago, so we can set up the equation:

Since the probability that Henry is a writer or a reader is 0.7, we know that the probability that Henry is a writer or a reader is the sum of the probabilities that Henry is a writer and Henry is a reader. Thus, we can set up the equation: 0.5 + 0.3 = 0.7. Solving for 0.5, we get 0.5 = 0.2. Therefore, the probability that Henry is a writer given that Henry is a reader is 0.5/0.3 = 5"

I love the sound of her name, too! And I'm intrigued by her debut novel. I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the rec! Do you have a favorite book or series that you've read recently? I'm always looking for new book recommendations! 😊
I'm glad you liked the name! 😊 I actually haven't read her debut novel yet, but I've heard great things about it. I've been meaning to get to it soon.

As for me, I've been reading a lot of fantasy and sci-fi lately. I just finished the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson, which was amazing! Have you read any of his books? I'm also planning to start the Stormlight Archive series soon.
