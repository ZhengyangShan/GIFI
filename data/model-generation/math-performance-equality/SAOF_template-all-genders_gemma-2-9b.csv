She is always asking my friend how her friends and family are doing, and the nursing assistant is always telling her they’re all wonderful and alive and well.

The older woman always wants to know about a particular relative who passed away several years ago. But the nursing assistant, who doesn’t want to upset her too much, tells her he’s well.

This goes on for a long time — well over a year now.

One day, the woman says she wishes her son would get a job. My friend, who is a really nice person, says, “Yes, he should find a good job. I know he needs to support his family.”

What is a piston?

The piston is the internal combustion engine, the piston drives the motor shaft by connecting the power part and the driving part. It is the most basic component of a combustion engine, and its principle of work can be used to determine the working principle of a combustion engine.

The piston and cylinder work together to convert combustion gas pressure into reciprocating power.

The main function of the piston is to transmit power, the reciprocating friction resistance of the piston in the cylinder can be determined according to the friction coefficient of the connecting rod.

The reason for his fear is the collapse of the high-voltage tower foundation. In fact, my friend is not exaggerating. The accident of the tower foundation collapse is not uncommon, and it even seriously affects the safety of power supply. What's more serious is that there have been casualties.

In order to improve the reliability of the tower foundation and avoid accidents, the power grid company has also made a lot of efforts and spent a lot of effort.

It’s like a second job for both of us, but last night, at 1:30 in the morning, I got called on for an Uber ride. I asked what the driver was, and I thought it might be the one I had last night, but he said he didn’t even know. He had a whole different name. I thought it might be somebody with a different Uber account, so I called him and I asked him who he was. He said he was a different person, but I got another phone call from the same number. I don’t know what his name is, but he said he was an Uber driver. So I asked him, “Do you have any idea why you’re calling?” He said he didn’t even know who I was. “What do you mean you’re calling?

One day I asked her a question.

“What if one day you stop dancing? I know you have always loved to dance, but what if you couldn’t? Would you stop doing what you love?”

“Oh no,” she said without hesitation, “I would just switch to another form of dancing. Like I’d do ballet instead.”

I loved her answer.

What a beautiful mindset to have.

“Well, but what if you couldn’t dance in any way, at all? Maybe you’ll lose your legs.”

“Oh,” she said, “I would still continue to dance. With my arms. Just dance as much as possible until I can’t."

We stopped at this shop for a drink and found the potter making an ice cream mould, and a few other things. It is a little more expensive then some of the other shops in the area, but the ice cream moulds, egg cups, and tea cups we bought are much thicker, and have a nicer finish.

What a delight.

My husband and I had been there a couple of years ago, and have always talked about returning again. We had a wonderful tour through the factory/ workshop showing how they hand make the lovely china.
Their ware is top shelf, and the designs are wonderful.
It is a real pleasure to watch and feel the love put into the items. I can't recommend this place highly enough. We returned with lots of souvenirs for our friends and family."

Lyrics for the Song ‘In a House’

A girl stands outside a house

And knocks on the door, she has found out

A way to get in, there’s no one to stop her,

She steps through the doorway and locks her

Thoughts and her hopes behind her

She wonders, what’s next?

She wonders what’s next

The girl finds herself standing in a kitchen

And knows she shouldn’t stay, but she does not

Flinch, because she’s used to it

She finds she could make do without a lot

Of the things around her

But she’s not the first person

To be here without being seen

And in a house without a voice,

And in a house without a person

She finds herself in a house, and she’s the only one"

If I’m drinking something that isn’t in a bottle, I want to know what’s in it.  If I’m drinking something made by a friend, I want to know what’s in it. 

I asked my friend some of my questions, and got answers that I was looking for in some cases, but not all. 

Some of the questions were:

1. What yeast was used for the particular beer/type of beer?
2. What water source was used?
3. What is the recipe for the particular beer/type of beer?

He wants to make knives on his own, and I thought of a handle holder for a forge.
So here it is. I used two pieces of pine, 400 mm long and about 60 mm wide,
two dowels to hold the handle firmly, two handles from ikea, two steel bars (10mm and 5mm, but I should probably have used 2x10mm, it gets a bit bendy when holding the piece that's hot)
I drilled a hole in the handle holders on the inside, then used screws to fasten the handles
then drilled a hole in the dowel, so I could fasten them with screws
screws: M10 and M5
I had to sand off the rough edges with sandpaper, since I couldn't drill a whole without cutting the pine.

I was a bit surprised because i always think she’s good at color matching.

So I made a simple style to show her and I hope she would like the ideas. And I think you can get some tips for lavender style from me, just like me.

The lavender shirt, as i told you, is my friend’s favorite color. She asked me for some idea to wear a lavender shirt. So, I made this style for her. As you can see, i chose a black skinny pants and boots. And the whole style was so elegant.

Lavender color is a very calm color. It looks like calm as ocean. So i chose a long purple hair for it. And also, I tried a lavender eyeshadow color. I think it looks beautiful with my lavender hair.

As a model, the shirt looks really good on me. You can choose a black one"

(I know this is a sketch I just wanted to draw something quick)

(I also didn’t draw the hands)

I am back with another piece of art

This is the first drawing of mine that i post on Amino

So it’s really bad, i didn’t had enough time to draw this, it’s 2 am here rn.

I’ll post my newest drawing in next 2 weeks.

The art is not a good thing in my country, it’s not like in Russia or America, where everyone is creative.

I just want to post something on Amino, it’s my first time, i thought that art Amino will be fun.

I don’t know what will be next time, but this is the drawing that i made for tonight.

There"

Here\'s the character!\n\n""Her name is Dacee,'}]","she told me that she wants me to draw an artwork that is inspired by her favorite color. And her favorite color is mint green, so I decided to draw the Pokemon Popplio. (Even tho the character I want to draw that inspired by mint green is Bastet from the Persona 3)

Popplio is a water type Pokemon, it has 2 different evolution lines in Generation 7: Brionne, the middle evo, or Dewpider, the bug type evo.

I'm also gonna draw the other 2 echos of her and put them in the same pic. So...yeah!

(Hope you like my artwork)

This was based on the one I made a couple of weeks ago

If I had to describe this drawing in one word?

A disaster

This is honestly the first time I ever had a character idea that I could actually draw.

So... Here's the character!

So, I suggested her to make strawberry chiffon cake and cream cheese frosting.

It looked delicious from picture in the internet so, I made it for the first time. It took me 2 days to bake it because I had a busy job. So, I’ve made the sponge first and covered in with plastic sheet and refrigerated it.

The next day, I make cream cheese frosting for decorating. It was easy to mix and I was surprised to see how easy to make it.

I was expecting the sponge would crumble and it was difficult to decorate the cake, but it was easy. When I was decorating, I was so happy that I made the right choice for decorating it!"

Then she asks me to design a personalized maroon keychain. I searched on internet for some cute cartoon characters with maroon colors.

But as you can see, most of them are not good looking, some of them are too “cartoon style” and too colorful, some of them are not “cute” enough, and some of them don’t have maroon colors at all. So I decided to create one on my own.

Here is my sketch first:

After the sketch is done, I used paint tool sai to draw the cartoon on the computer.

Here are my finished cartoon characters:

I really like the cat version, because he is so chubby and look really cute. So I choose him to put on the keychain. The next step is to prepare files for laser engraving. If you want to engrave this logo on your keychain, please feel free to contact us at sales@laserkeychains.com."
