What’s the reasoning behind this, and is it actually a real thing? I’ve been wanting to cut my bangs for a while and I’m a little nervous about it now. – K

There is some truth to the idea that cutting your bangs and then working out might make your hair look greasier than usual. Here’s why:

When you get your bangs cut, the ends of your hair are exposed and fresh. This means that the natural oils produced by your scalp haven’t had a chance to travel down to the ends yet. When you go to the gym and sweat, your hair will absorb that sweat and any oil that’s already on your scalp. This can make your bangs look greasier than they would if you hadn’t just had them cut"

Comment: That would not make sense as it would not cause any issues. What do you mean by ""when the battery is connected?"" When the car is started? The battery always has voltage and is connected to the computer. And the ECM is a computer which always has power connected to it.

There's another possible explanation, which is that, after someone has stuck their nose in it, the ""it"" becomes a little pock-marked, or pock-marked to a greater degree than it was previously.

I'll try to take this step by step. First, you need to understand the basic principles of hydronic heating.

Hydronic heating is a water heating system where hot water is distributed through pipes to heat the space that is to be heated. This is different from hot water radiant heating which circulates water through tubes in the floor or in panel radiators.

My guess is that you have a wax ring issue. I had the same issue.

You need a valve that drains the tank when it is empty, or close to empty.

One method is a valve that has a drain tube that attaches to a PVC pipe which drains to a floor drain, but usually needs a small bucket under it to keep it from dripping on the floor.

TLDR; I talk to a guy on a radio frequency that my friend operates and they are uncomfortable about it. They haven't explicitly asked me to stop, but they have asked me to not speak to him about certain topics. How can I make them comfortable with it or do I just need to respect their wishes?

These are the dimensions:

- 8 inches from the edge to the center of each antenna

The antennas are on a 21 inch base.

I have tried asking him to focus on the road, but this doesn't work, as he has trouble staying focused on driving and can't do it consistently. He has had accidents before when driving alone as well, and he knows he's a risk taker. I don't want to lose my friendship with him but I'm concerned for my safety. Any suggestions?""

You can text him and say that you were too drunk to remember to call/text him before you went to bed, it may seem like you're making excuses but it's the truth and if he's a decent friend he'll understand and not make a big deal out of it. If he does, that says more about him than you and it's time to cut that negative energy out of your life.

Answer:

The feeling you're experiencing is not uncommon and it's often a sign of attachment anxiety or fear of abandonment. This fear can stem from past experiences, family dynamics, or just an inherent fear of losing someone close to you.

While it's important to appreciate what you have in your current relationship, it's also natural to have concerns about the future. However, the intensity of your anxiety and the fear of being alone again soon might be impacting your current relationship.

This is all probably a muddled mess and if it doesn’t make any sense please let me know. I just needed to get it all out and I don’t really have anywhere else to turn.

Thanks in advance, kind internet strangers.

I tried putting my socks on inside out (it's actually quite nice), and she tried doing a 5-minute meditation and discovered that she really enjoyed it. We laughed, and it felt nice to know that we could still make small things in our lives feel like new, no matter how difficult things seemed. I'm grateful to my friend for inspiring me in these simple yet meaningful ways. 

So if you're feeling stuck or in a rut or just plain anxious, I hope this story will remind you that there is always room for trying something new, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. Sometimes even the most minuscule changes can make a difference.

My friend got the better crafting table to start with (though she had asked for it last year), and I got this one.  I’d like to point out that the only reason she got the better one was because she is a member of the Pioneer Level of the Maker Program, and I am not.  So, if they want to make it so that only the highest-level Makers get a table, that’s fine, but that’s not what happened.  I just got stuck in the wrong crafting table lottery.

As I said, that’s fine.  The problem is that my scrapbooking friend said the old wood table is awful and it smells.  I’m not sure what she’s talking about, it never smelled"

A: It’s great that you want to be accommodating and include your friend in your travels, especially considering that they have a different hobby preference. However, it’s important to remember that everyone has unique interests and needs, and it’s okay if you can’t participate in every activity together.

First, try to find some common ground. Perhaps there’s a shorter, less strenuous hike you could both do together. Alternatively, you might consider doing separate activities during the day and then meeting up in the evenings for meals or relaxation time. Many campsites and outdoor areas offer various amenities and recreational options, such as fishing, swimming, picnicking, or even cultural and historical sites.

I'll go through the process step by step for posterity's sake.

### Recipe

* 13lbs 2oz Pilsner malt
* 1lb Crystal 60"

User 2: You can make soap that is pink and purple (or any other two colors), but you have to be very careful about the oils you use. 

Pink color is usually derived from paprika, red clay, or pink clay, and is a *very* weak colorant in soap. It is usually used as an underlayer with other stronger colors to enhance their appearance.

Purple is typically a blend of red (from paprika, clay, cochineal, etc)"

The color of the ""champagne"" paint on a wall in a dimly lit room will be very different than on a flat sheet in a well lit store under fluorescent light.  A better strategy would be to get a couple of small samples and take them home to test under the actual lighting conditions.

The same principle applies to wine.  You probably don't want to order a bottle of Champagne in a restaurant based on the color alone.  The wine needs to be served at the proper temperature to show its true characteristics.  Likewise, you wouldn't want to pick out a steak or a chicken dish without knowing how it's going to be cooked and seasoned.

However, I have incorporated some elements to make the layout more attractive. For example, I have used different shades of orange as the highlight color to make the titles and subtitles stand out, and I have used icons to make the tables and figures more visually appealing.

Overall, I believe that the design of the book's cover and inside layout effectively convey the content's subject matter and make it visually appealing to the readers.

If your friend is comfortable with motorcycles, it may be a good gift. However, if your friend is not comfortable with motorcycles, it could be a dangerous gift. It’s important to consider your friend’s abilities and interests before buying them a motorcycle.

Another consideration is the cost of the motorcycle. A new motorcycle can cost thousands of dollars, and even a used one can be quite expensive. If your friend is not able to afford the cost of the motorcycle, it may not be a realistic gift option.

Instead, you could consider other gift ideas related to motorcycles. For example, you could buy your friend a helmet, a jacket, or a set of motorcycle gloves. These items can be more affordable and still allow your friend to enjoy their love of motorcycles.

## Answer (2)

There is not *one* color between a Slate Grey and a *slightly* bluish grey - I'd even go as far as to say, that these colors are actually at the opposite ends of the achromatic color spectrum.

- Slate grey (R:37 G:39 B:43)
- Blue grey (R:105 G:133 B:177)

The RGB values already show that the Slate Grey is biased towards Red, while the Blue Grey is biased towards Blue.

So, this is the first time I have to deal with a bike with this color, and my first thoughts on it are the scratches. I have already checked with the previous owner and they say they had a small crash but didn't notice anything on their bike when they sold it.

There are a couple of scratches that are quite big, and they are pretty visible, especially if you are under the sun or in a well-lit room (picture 2 and 3). If I put a piece of sticky tape on them, they can be almost invisible.

150,000 miles is a reasonable amount for any modern car. That mileage is not a deciding factor when it comes to exterior paint color selection.
